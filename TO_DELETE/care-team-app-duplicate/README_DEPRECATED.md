# Deprecated Directory: care-team-app

This folder contains a stale duplicate of the active Flask backend (`workforce-management-system`).

Status (Aug 2025):
- Retained temporarily for diff / verification.
- No unique templates or integration code; primary `app.py` lives only in `workforce-management-system/`.
- Will be removed in Phase B of the refactor once confirmed unnecessary.

Next Steps:
1. Verify no references in scripts or deployment configs.
2. Remove this directory entirely (git rm -r care-team-app).

If you believe something here is still needed, migrate it into the canonical backend before removal.
